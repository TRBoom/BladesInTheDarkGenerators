# BladesInTheDarkGenerators
A couple of generators I built for Blades in the Dark using the tables in the back of the book. 

Run the program from the terminal to get a quick description.
For ease of modification, each table from the book is it's own .json dump from a python list.
If the table options had more than one option for a given roll, they were split out so each is it's own entry.
Due to inconsistency on the tables, sometimes the output is imperfect in terms of case/tense.

Streets:
Get a random street description using the information from page 300 of the Blades in the Dark sourcebook.

Buildings:
Get a random building description using the information from page 301. Use the arguments "rare" or "common" in
the terminal to decide which table to roll from.

People:
Get a random NPC from the data on pages 302 and 303. Use the arguments "rare" or "common" in the terminal to 
decide which profession table to roll from.

Demons:
Creates a random demon out of the data on page 304. 

Ghosts:
Creates a random ghost using the ghost tables on page 304. Also uses the names/aliases from page 303 to give
a name to the ghost.
